# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This beginner-friendly Machine Learning project uses the famous **Iris dataset** to classify flowers into 3 species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using **Decision Tree** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifiers.

---

## 📊 Dataset Used
- Iris dataset (available from `sklearn.datasets`)
- Features used: Petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width

---

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Google Colab

---

## 🔍 Steps Followed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Visualized feature relationships using Seaborn
3. Preprocessed data and split into training/testing
4. Built models using:
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
5. Compared performance using accuracy scores
6. Visualized decision boundaries using plots

---

## 📈 Model Performance
- Compared Decision Tree and KNN on accuracy
- Visualized how each model draws decision boundaries
